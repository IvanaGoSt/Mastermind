# Mastermind

The Odin-Project assignment.
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.
Than refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether he/she wants to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
The computer player's algorithm is very, very, very simple. It doesn't win all the time.
